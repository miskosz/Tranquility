Graphs generated by program 'plantri' developed by Gunnar Brinkmann and Brendan McKay.

Every file contains all 3-connected planar Eulerian triangulations with a given number of vertices.
Command used to generate the graphs:
> plantri -ab [nVertices]

Graphs are in ASCII CODE (see Appendix A). (Text taken from 'plantri' documentation.)
For number of the graphs see Appendix B. (Text taken from 'plantri' documentation.)


APPENDIX A.  Definition of PLANAR CODE.

  PLANAR CODE is the default format.  It is the preferred format if you plan
     to feed the graph into a program that needs the imbedding, and also
     convenient if you don't need the imbedding.  However, it uses characters
     which are not printable so it is not suitable for looking at by eye.

  ASCII CODE is a human-readable version of planar code.  The vertices of
     the graph are named by ASCII characters starting with 'a'.  Example:
        7 bcdefg,agfdc,abd,acbfe,adf,aedbg,afb
     This is a graph with 7 vertices a,b,c,d,e,f,g.  The neighbours of
     'a' in clockwise order are b,c,d,e,f,g; and so on.  Each graph occupies
     one line of output.  Ascii code is convenient if you just want to draw
     a few graphs by hand.
     To select ascii code use -a.

  PLANAR CODE is the default output format for plantri.  The vertices of
  the graph are numbered starting at 1.  PLANAR CODE represents the graph
  by a series of bytes, whose unsigned numerical values (0..255) are
  significant.  The first byte gives the number of vertices n.  Then there
  are n sections, where section v contains the neighbours of vertex v in
  clockwise order followed by a zero byte.   There is no end-of-line
  character appended.

  For example, the graph of Figure 1 is represented by the following
  byte values:

          5  3 4 0  3 5 0  1 4 5 2 0  1 5 3 0  2 3 4 0

  In case there are parallel edges, there might be more than one graph
  whose PLANAR CODE is the same up to rotation of the neighbour lists. 
  To resolve this ambiguity, plantri makes the following convention:
  for each vertex v except for the first vertex, if the least numbered
  vertex that has v as a neighbour is w, then the first w in the section
  for v represents the same edge as the first v in the section for w.
  
  In case of all the graph classes generated by plantri that have no
  multiple loops, and also for all classes of triangulations, it can be
  proved that for every v > 1 we have w < v and the embedded graph is
  uniquely reconstructible from the code.

  In addition to the encodings of graphs, a PLANAR CODE file by default
  begins with the 15 characters >>planar_code<< without end-of-line
  characters.
 
  
APPENDIX B.  Graph Counts.

  The column headings in these tables are:

  nv = number of vertices (or faces in the dual)
  ne = number of edges (same in the dual)
  nf = number of faces (or vertices in the dual)
  all = count of isomorphism classes
