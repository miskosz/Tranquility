### Michal Szabados 2013 ###

Bunch of utilities to generate all triangulations of an equilateral triangle
with given size in a triangular grid. It is a part of my diploma thesis.

## Prerequisities ##
- g++ compiler

## How to install ##
1) Go to scripts directory
	> cd scripts/
2) Compile the program
	> make

## How to run the program ##
For detailed information use
	> ./scripts/tranquility -h
Example use:
	> ./scripts/tranquility < plantri_graphs/graph10

## How to view generated triangulations ##
1) View show_triangulation.php in web browser
2) Paste the output of the program into the third textarea
