### Triagulations of Equilateral Triangles ###
### Michal Szabados 2012- ###

Bunch of utilities to generate all triangulations of an equilateral triangle
with given size in a triangular grid. It is a part of my diploma thesis.

## How to install ##

You will need
- mysql database
- g++ compiler with libmysql (usually is preinstalled)
- for triangulation visualization the directu=ory must be placed in php parsed
  web directory

# Load graphs into the database #

1) Go to plantri_graphs directory
	> cd plantri_graphs/
2) Generate SQL inserts from plantri output
	> ../scripts/plantri_to_sql.sh ! -iname "*.*"
3) Log into mysql database
4) Load graphs into the database
	mysql> SOURCE plantri_graphs/reload_all.sql

# Compute triangulations #

1) Go to scripts directory
	> cd scripts/
2) Put in your mysql credential
	> cp db_credentials.template.h db_credentials.h
	> vim db_credentials.h
2) Compile the program
	> make
3) Use tranquility.sh, adhere to the usage instructions
	> ./run_tranquility.sh

# View triangulations #

1) Edit show_triangulation.php, find "Connect to the database" line and edit
   the mysql credentials
	> vim show_triangulation.php
2) View show_triangulation.php in web browser
